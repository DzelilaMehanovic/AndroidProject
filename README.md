Project Proposal  
The application is intended for children and offers them the opportunity to learn the basic words in the English language in easy way.  
At the beginning the user sees four options. Three of them are for learning new words and one of them is for checking knowledge about words in these three sections.  
User can choose to learn colors, animals or numbers. In each of these three sections is a certain number of words that a child can learn.  
The child learns words by seeing the image that represents word on the screen and hear a pronunciation.  
For example: if word is animal - cat, child can see image of cat on screen and hear pronunciation: “cat”. 
In the section 'play' user can check knowledge through examples.  
For example: There are shown three images that are located in one of the other three sections and child can hear pronunciation of word. His/her task is to click on the image whose name is pronounced.  
There is a possibility that the user will see a few items of the same kind and offered a few numbers. His/her task is to click on the number that denotes how many items is shown. 
Depending on whether the answer is correct or incorrect different sound is heard. 
There is home icon that should be clicked to return to main menu.  
The application does not have the option of creating accounts or getting points for correct answers and does not contain progress bar.
